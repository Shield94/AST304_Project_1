This effect is magnified with larger time steps. The effect is also magnified with which method one chooses. RK4 seems unaffected beacuse it has a larger truncation. This means that even at larger time steps, the error is minigated. I will note; however, the second to last point in RK4 is odd. I did not expect it to go down, but could be a result of random motion because of the large time step. The same reasoning could be applied to the last point of RK2.\n",
