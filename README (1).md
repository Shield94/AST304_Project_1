Kepler
======

Project directory for comparison of ODE solvers and usage of the solvers to integrate orbits of two point particles (Kepler's problem). A description of the integration methods, Kepler's problem, and instructions for completing this project is available on D2L.

Contents of this directory
--------------------------

*  `README.md`  
This file

*  `ode.py`  
Routines to advance the solution of a system of first-order ODEs by one step

*  `kepler.py`  
Routines to integrate orbits and compute energies for two particles interacting 
via an attractive 1/r potential

Report/closeout
---------------

1.  Modify this README file by replacing instructions from me with your  instructions on how to run the code.
2. Inform Wasundara and I when you are ready to have your code reviewed.
3. Write your report in a concise, professional manner and upload a pdf of your report with your submission to D2L.
